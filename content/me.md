👋你好，我是裘成虎，上海大学的一名本科生。

这个博客是我一时心血来潮创建的一个小天地，或许它不会太正式，也不会太复杂，但它一定是真实且自由的。
在这里，我会记录我的生活点滴、思维火花、学习心得，也可能是某个深夜的灵感片段。

如果你对我的内容有兴趣，或者想与我交流、讨论甚至合作，欢迎随时联系我 


My name is Chenghu Qiu, an undergraduate student at Shanghai University.

This blog was born on a whim — a little personal corner of the internet where I can freely express myself.
Here, I’ll be sharing moments from my life, sparks of inspiration, thoughts on learning, and maybe the occasional late-night idea.

If you’re interested in what I share, or you’d like to chat, collaborate, or exchange ideas, feel free to reach out
